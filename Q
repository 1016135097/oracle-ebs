Restricting Items to Subinventories
You can assign items to a given subinventory.  Assigning items to a subinventory does not restrict the subinventory to that list of items.  Rather, the items are restricted to that subinventory.  Thus, you can always issue and receive unrestricted items to any subinventory, but you can only issue and receive restricted items to those particular subinventories.  You activate the list of subinventories for a restricted item when you set the Restrict Subinventories attribute. You also use the item-subinventory relationship to specify valid subinventories for zero quantity cycle counts for an item, and to specify items for an ABC analysis performed at the subinventory level.  In these cases you do not have to set the Restrict Subinventories attribute, only establish the relationship between the item and subinventory.
