you should read the documentation even once, because there are details that could effect your understanding on what is going on that are not exist in the student guides

**ex:** when querying on-hand by receipt number you could think that i will query the receipted items even if they have been transacted, while the documentation say this:

- On-hand material can be traced back to the receipt number only when the
material is still in its original storage location. For example, suppose you
receive an item against Receipt #345, deliver the material to Locator B1.1.1,
and then move it to B1.1.2. When you query the on-hand material by
Receipt #345, your search displays only the material that is still in its initial
location of B1.1.1. (After you move it to B1.1.2, the link between the
on-hand material and Receipt #345 is lost and no material will be found.)
