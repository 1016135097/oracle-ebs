Function
A function is a part of an application's functionality that is registered under a unique name for the purpose of assigning it to, or excluding it from, a responsibility.
There are two types of functions: executable functions (formerly called form functions), and non-executable functions (formerly called subfunctions).

Executable Function
Executable functions have the unique property that you may navigate to them using the Navigate window.

?Non-executable Function
A non-executable function) is a securable subset of a form's functionality: in other words, a function executed from within a form.
A developer can write a form to test the availability of a particular non-executable function, and then take some action based on whether the non-executable function is available in the current responsibility.
Non-executable functions are frequently associated with buttons or other graphical elements on forms. For example, when a non-executable function is enabled, the corresponding button is enabled.
However, a non-executable function may be tested and executed at any time during a form's operation, and it need not have an explicit user interface impact. For example, if a non-executable function corresponds to a form procedure not associated with a graphical element, its availability is not obvious to the form's user.

Menu
A menu is a hierarchical arrangement of functions and menus of functions. Each responsibility has a menu assigned to it.
Menus can map to permission sets as well.

Menu Entry
A menu entry is a menu component that identifies a function or a menu of functions. In some cases, both a function and a menu of functions correspond to the same menu entry. For example, both a form and its menu of subfunctions can occupy the same menu entry.

Responsibility
A responsibility defines an application user's current privileges while working with Oracle E-Business Suite.
