-flexfield qualifier 
identifies a particular segment of a key flexfield
Usually an application needs some method of identifying a particular segment for some
application purpose such as security or computations. However, since a key flexfield
can be customized so that segments appear in any order with any prompts, the
application needs a mechanism other than the segment name or segment order to use
for segment identification. Flexfield qualifiers serve this purpose. You can think of a
flexfield qualifier as an "identification tag" for a segment.

A segment qualifier identifies a particular type of value in a single segment of a key
flexfield.

**Planning
Decide which flexfields to implement
• Learning about a specific flexfield
• Planning the structure
• Planning the segments
• Planning the segment validation
• Planning to use additional features
• Documenting your plan

Tip: We recommend that you plan your flexfields as completely as
possible, including your potential segment values, before you even
begin to define them using Oracle E-Business Suite forms. Once
you begin using your flexfields to acquire data, you cannot change
them easily. Changing a flexfield for which you already have data
may require a complex conversion process.



You should fully document your flexfield plans before you sit down to define your
flexfields using your Oracle E-Business Suite setup forms.
We provide worksheets and templates throughout the book that you can use to aid
your decision and documentation process.
