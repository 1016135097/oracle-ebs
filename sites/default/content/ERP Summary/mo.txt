what knowledge is lacking
the best way to present it, be proffesoinal in it
arabic,english,both?
(video, book, ...) , (how to make/organize the video, book, ...)
who to deliver it to whom need it
is this knowledge is updating often (like programming topics), or fixed knowledge (like religion)

organizing the knowledge flow


beginner and intermediate levels could be in videos
but advanced things is hard to make in videos, because it needs deep understanding and focus, so you have to be sure that the kind of viedo you will make will deliver that, otherwise translate a book or something else.


university that publish the knowledge for free
and provide real tranning and certifications for money
