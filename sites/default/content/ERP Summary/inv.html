Primary Unit of Measure
When you define an item you establish a primary unit of measure.  
The system tracks on-hand quantity and calculates transactions based on the primary unit of measure.
Secondary Unit of Measure  
You can optionally establish a secondary unit of measure (dual unit of measure control) for an item. 
Secondary unit of measure can be used for cases where you need to track in two units of measure and there is no constant conversion between the two unit of measures (UOMs). 
For example, chickens can be tracked in pounds and eaches. 
If an item is under dual unit of measure control the system tracks on-hand quantity based on both the primary and secondary units of measure. For example, you can track an item in both eaches and liters.
