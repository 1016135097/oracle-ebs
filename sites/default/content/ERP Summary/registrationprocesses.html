Provisioning services are modeled as registration processes that enable end users to
perform some of their own registration tasks, such as requesting new accounts or
additional access to the system. They also provide administrators with a faster and
more efficient method of creating new user accounts, as well as assigning roles.

Registration processes accomplish this by encapsulating core components of registration, including:
- The role(s) assigned after the user successfully completes the process.
- An optional registration user interface for collecting account or additional information.
- A workflow for approval, confirmation, rejection, and identity verification notifications.
- The Approval Management Transaction Type. A transaction type represents a set of
approval routing rules that are interpreted at runtime.
- The set of users that are eligible to sign up for additional access (only applicable for
Request for Additional Access registration processes).
- Whether identity verification is required. Identity verification confirms the identity
of a requester before the registration request is processed, by sending an email
notification to the requester's email address. If the recipient does not reply within a
specified time, the request will be automatically rejected.
- The set of local administrators that should be able to register people and/or create
users through the Account Creation by Administrators registration process.

When a user completes registration using a registration process, the system captures the
required information from the user, and subsequently assigns that person a new user
account, role, or both. Oracle User Management supports three types of registration
processes:

- self-service account requests
Commonly referred to as Self-Service Registration, self-service account requests provide
a method for individuals to request a new user account.



- request for additional access 

- account creation by administrators
