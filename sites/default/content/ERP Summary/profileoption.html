System Administrators control various profile options in Oracle Applications that determine how the applications look, feel, and operate.

You define new user profile options when you build an application. Once you define an option, you can control access for it at different profile levels.
Before defining your user profile options, define your application using the Applications window.

You identify a profile option by application name and profile option name.
