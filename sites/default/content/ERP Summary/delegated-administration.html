- Delegated (tafweed) Administration
Enables system administrators to delegate some of their administrative privileges to individuals that manage a subset of the
organization's users. These individuals are assigned administrative privileges for a limited set of roles that they can assign to the users they manage.

Delegation policies are defined as data security policies. The
set of data policies that are defined as part of delegated administration are known as <strong>Administration Privileges</strong>.

<strong>Administration Privileges</strong>
Administration Privileges determine the users, roles and organization information that
delegated administrators (local administrators) can manage.Each privilege is granted
separately, yet the three work in conjunction to provide the complete set of abilities for
the delegated administrator.

- User Adminstration Privileges
determine the users and people the local administrator can manage.
Local administrators can be granted different privileges for different
subsets of users. For example, a local administrator can be granted privileges only
to query one set of users, and granted full privileges (including update and reset
password) for another set.
Local administrators cannot query or manage users for which they do not have administration privileges.

- Role Adminstration Privileges
define the roles that local administrators can directly assign to and revoke from the set of users they
manage.

- Organization Adminstration Privileges
define the external organizations a local administrator can view in Oracle User
Management. This privilege enables an administrator to search for people based on
their organization, if the local administrator has additionally been granted access to
view the people in that organization (User Administration Privileges). Depending
on the user administration privileges, an administrator may have the ability to
register new people for that organization.

Oracle Applications continues to support the traditional "System Administrator" level
of administration privileges, where a designated group of people manages all users and
access privileges. Oracle User Management ships a predefined Security Administrator
role, which gives the administrator the privileges to manage all users including system
accounts and all roles in the system.


<strong>Delegating to Proxy Users</strong>
There are a number of business scenarios in which users of Oracle E-Business Suite
need to grant delegates the ability to act on their behalf (act as proxy users for them)
when performing specific E-Business Suite functions.

If a delegator grants a delegate access to
his password, the delegate will be able to access every application to
which the delegator has access, not just to specific applications. The new mechanism
was designed to enable limited, auditable delegation of privilege from delegators to
their delegates.

Employing the Proxy User mechanism gives all-or-nothing
delegation capability. However, start and end dates can be defined to
limit the duration of proxy access.

The ability for users to access the proxy feature is controlled by a Security Administrator
role. Users with this role determine which set of users can create delegates who can act
on their behalf.
