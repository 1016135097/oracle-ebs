-Request Group (if needed) ??Note: The Request Security Groups feature is provided for backward compatibility.
New responsibilities should be created in accordance with Role-Based Access Control and should not have a default request security group.
When a request group is assigned to a responsibility, it becomes a request security group.

You can control user access to requests and request sets using request security groups
or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

A request security group can contain requests and request sets from different
applications.

If you do not include the Submit Requests form on the menu for a responsibility, then
you do not need to assign a request security group to the responsibility.
