Request Groups Window
Use this window to define a request group. A request security group is the collection of requests, request sets, and concurrent programs that a user, operating under a given responsibility, can select from the Submit Requests window.

System Administrators:
Assign a request security group to a responsibility when defining that responsibility. A responsibility without a request security group cannot run any requests using the Submit Requests window.
Can add any request set to a request security group. Adding a private request set to a request security group allows other users to run that request set using the Submit Requests window.

Users:
Can create their own private request sets using the Request Sets window. In a private request set, users can include only the requests you assign to their request security group.
Cannot update another user's private request set using the Request Sets window.
Cannot delete a private request set if it is assigned to a request security group.


type
Choose program or set to add one item, or choose application to include all requests in an application.


You can define a request group to contain single requests, request sets, or all the requests and request sets in an application.

Two types of Request Group

A request group is used by Oracle Applications at two different levels:
1.	Responsibility level
When a request group is assigned to a responsibility, it is referred to as a request security group, and it defines the reports, request sets, and concurrent programs that a user, operating under that responsibility, can select from the Submit Requests Window.
2.	Form level
When a request group is assigned a code, that code can be passed as a parameter to the Submit Requests Window. The code helps define the function that calls the Submit Requests Window.
The list of values for that unique Submit Requests Window lists the reports, request sets, and concurrent programs in the request group.
