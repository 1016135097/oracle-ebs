A responsibility is a level of authority in Oracle E-Business Suite. It enables your access to those functions and data appropriate for your enterprise role. You can have one or more responsibilities.

A responsibility is a set of data, menus, and forms that defines your particular level of authority while using the system. 

A responsibility determines whether the user accesses Oracle E-Business Suite or Oracle Mobile Applications; which applications functions a user can use; which reports and concurrent programs the user can run; and which data those reports and concurrent programs can access.

A responsibility provides a context in which a user operates. This context can include profile option values, navigation menus, available concurrent programs, and so on.

A responsibility is uniquely identified by application name and responsibility name.

System adminstrator > security > responsibility > define

Each user has at least one or more responsibilities, and multiple users can share the same responsibility. A system administrator can assign users any of the standard responsibilities provided with Oracle E-Business Suite, or create new custom responsibilities if required.

Each responsibility would be associated with a single Application

A system administrator can assign users any of the standard responsibilities provided with Oracle E-Business Suite, or create new custom responsibilities if required.

Responsibilities cannot be deleted.
To prevent a responsibility from being used, set the Effective Date's To field to a past date and restart Oracle E-Business Suite.
=You cannot delete a responsibility, because its information helps to provide an audit trail.You can deactivate a responsibility at any time by setting the end date to the current date. If you wish to reactivate the responsibility later, either change the end date to a date after the current date, or clear the end date.

** DEFINING **
when defining new responsibility the following must be pre-difined:
-Data Group  ??Note: Data groups are used for backward compatibility only. Oracle Application Framework does not support the data groups feature.
-Request Group (if needed)
???Note: The Request Security Groups feature is provided for backward compatibility.
New responsibilities should be created in accordance with Role-Based Access Control and should not have a default request security group.
-Menus
-Menu Exclusions
-??Excluded Items
-??Securing Attributes

An application (The owning application for the responsibility) name and a responsibility name uniquely identify a responsibility.
This application name does not prevent the user of this responsibility from accessing other applications' forms and functions if you define the menu to access other applications.

This is the internal key for the responsibility that is used by loader programs, (concurrent programs that load messages, user profiles, user profile values, and other information into Oracle E-Business Suite tables). The responsibility key is unique per application.
Avoid using the following characters in the responsibility keys: !, ", ;, [, ], (, ), {, }, %, |, <, >.

Menu Exclusions Block
Select either Function or Menu as the type of exclusion rule to apply against this responsibility.
-When you exclude a function from a responsibility, all occurrences of that function throughout the responsibility's menu structure are excluded.
-When you exclude a menu, all of its menu entries, that is, all the functions and menus of functions that it selects, are excluded.
