You allow a new user to sign-on to Oracle E-Business Suite by defining an application user. An application user has a username and a password. You define an initial password, then the first time the application user signs on, they must enter a new (secret) password.
When you define an application user, you assign to the user one or more responsibilities or zero.

You cannot delete an application user from Oracle E-Business Suite because this information helps to provide an audit trail.

<strong>Username</strong>
This user is an authorized user of Oracle E-Business Suite, and is uniquely identified by a username
The username should only contain characters allowed by Oracle Single Sign-On.

<strong>Password</strong>
A password must be at least five (5) characters and can be up to thirty (30) characters.
As System Administrator, you can set an initial password or change an existing password, but you cannot access the user's chosen password.
You can set the minimum length of Oracle E-Business Suite user passwords using the profile option Signon Password Length. If this profile option is left unset, the minimum length defaults to 5.
You can set the minimum number of days that a user must wait before being allowed to reuse a password with the Signon Password No Reuse profile option.
The Signon Password Failure Limit profile option determines the maximum number of login attempts before the user's account is disabled.

<strong>Status</strong>
The Status field indicates the status of the user account. This field is display-only and values are generated by the system
-Unassigned
-Pending
-Locked
-Active
-Inactive

?Securing Attributes
Securing attributes are used by some Oracle HTML-based applications to allow rows (records) of data to be visible to specified users or responsibilities based on the specific data (attribute values) contained in the row.
You may assign one or more values for any of the securing attributes assigned to the user. If a securing attribute is assigned to both a responsibility and to a user, but the user does not have a value for that securing attribute, no information is returned for that attribute.
For example, to allow a user in the ADMIN responsibility to see rows containing a CUSTOMER_ID value of 1000, assign the securing attribute of CUSTOMER_ID to the ADMIN responsibility. Then give the user a security attribute CUSTOMER_ID value of 1000.
When the user logs into the Admin responsibility, the only customer data they have access to has a CUSTOMER_ID value of 1000.

Attribute
Select an attribute you want used to determine which records this user can access. You can select from any of the attributes assigned to the user's responsibility.
Value
Enter the value for the attribute you want used to determine which records this user can access.




Monitor Users Window
Use this window to monitor what your application users are currently doing.
As well as seeing which users are signed on, you can see:
Which responsibilities and forms (windows) they are using
How long they have been logged in
What Oracle database processes they are using
