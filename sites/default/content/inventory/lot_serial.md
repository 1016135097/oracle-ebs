Lot control itself is a rather simple concept that ensures every piece of inventory that flows through a warehouse can be tracked to its group of origin.

You can divide each lot into child lots that can reflect whatever characteristics you choose for items within the lot. For example, you may divide a lot of items from a supplier into child lots to reflect differences in quality specifications.

A child lot is a subdivision of a lot that you can use if you produce a lot over a period of time, but still want to group the material as a single lot. Using a child lot maintains the integrity of the lot, but enables you to consume it in manageable pieces. When you process transactions for material under child lot control, you enter the child lot as the lot number. The system also maintains a genealogy relationship between the parent lot and the child lot
